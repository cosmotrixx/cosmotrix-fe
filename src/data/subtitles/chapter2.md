# Chapter 2 - The Hidden War Subtitles

1-1-V07: Pedroz was once a guardian, but his heart turned dark. He discovered the Voidlings, alien shadows who feed on cosmic storms. Together, they built a plan: trap the Sun's power, Flare and CMEs, then unleash it all at once… to shatter Earth.
2-1-V08: First, Pedroz showed the Flares how to attack. They went into the power-up machine—starting at Level A, then B, then C and M—getting stronger and stronger until they reached their super form: the mighty Level X Flares!
3-1-V09: Second, CME—the colossal bubble of the Sun's corona—builds its power, ready to unleash a storm of particles. With each surge of strength, the warning light turns—from green… to red.
4-1-V10: United, CME and the Flares become an unstoppable force—unleashing radiation storms that erupt into torrents of proton flux!
